# 🚀 Migration from Monolith to Microservices

## ✅ **Backup Created**
Your original Python backend has been backed up to `python-backend-backup/`

## 🏗️ **Microservices Architecture**

### **Services Overview:**
- **API Gateway**: Port 5000 (same as your monolith)
- **User Service**: Port 8001 (Authentication, profiles)
- **Broker Service**: Port 8002 (Fyers integration)
- **Portfolio Service**: Port 8003 (Holdings, portfolios)
- **Order Service**: Port 8004 (Order management)
- **Market Data Service**: Port 8005 (Real-time data)
- **Algorithm Service**: Port 8006 (Trading algorithms)
- **Alert Service**: Port 8007 (Smart alerts)
- **News Service**: Port 8008 (News aggregation)
- **WebSocket Service**: Port 8009 (Real-time streaming)

## 🔄 **Quick Switch Commands**

### Start Microservices:
```bash
./start-microservices.sh
```

### Switch Back to Monolith:
```bash
./switch-to-monolith.sh
```

## 🌐 **Frontend Compatibility**

✅ **Zero Changes Required** - Your React frontend will work immediately because:
- API Gateway runs on same port (5000)
- All existing endpoints preserved
- Same authentication flow
- WebSocket connections handled transparently

## 🔧 **Configuration**

Update `microservices/.env` with your Fyers credentials:
```bash
FYERS_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
FYERS_SECRET_KEY=your_actual_secret_key
```

## 📊 **Benefits**

- **Independent Scaling**: Scale services based on load
- **Fault Isolation**: Service failures don't affect others
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use optimal tech
- **Team Independence**: Different teams can work on different services
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Deploy services independently

## 🔍 **Monitoring**

Check service health:
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/health
```

View logs:
```bash
cd microservices
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]
```

## 🛠️ **Development**

Run individual services locally:
```bash
cd microservices/user-service
python main.py
```

## 📈 **Production Ready**

- Docker containerization
- Environment-based configuration
- Health monitoring
- Horizontal scaling
- Load balancing support
- Database connection pooling
